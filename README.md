# FinPatternRecognizer
Financial pattern recognizer demo
# What is this?
This is a financial pattern recognizer algorithm I build as part of my Rise for the World project.
It is similar to a neural network, in that it can flexibly identify patterns. But it is different in that it does not directly use any form of calculus.
There will be a youtube video explaining how this algorithm works in detail soon. 

Currently, it is only capable of operating in a sort of "back-test" mode. It only operates on previous historical data within the given time span. 
It should be quite straight-forward to make it work on live data as well, as it is only needed to change the time it is set to work on.

# Why?
I built it to prove that anyone can come up with alternative machine learning algorithms. And that it is necessary for more people to do so inorder to overcome the limitatios of traditional neural networks, and to put the control over the field of A.I. back into the hands of the people by encouraging more similar personal projects.

## It was not made with the purpose to make money in mind. It is not a "trading bot." It is a proof-of-concept project.
